Given a non-negative integer x, return the square root of x rounded down to the nearest integer. The returned integer should be non-negative as well.

You must not use any built-in exponent function or operator.

For example, do not use pow(x, 0.5) in c++ or x ** 0.5 in python.
 

Example 1:

Input: x = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 4 is 2, so we return 2.
Example 2:

Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since we round it down to the nearest integer, 2 is returned.
 

Constraints:

0 <= x <= 231 - 1

Comments:
I solved the sum using two methods : brute force and sqrt function.
Using sqrt function gave the most optimised solution out of both the methods!

Things I learnt: 
         
          1. Using sqrt function
          2. Using for loop to find the sqrt of a number
